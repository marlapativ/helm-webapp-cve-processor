Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.
The Helm chart has been successfully deployed.

Verifying the Deployment
------------------------
- To verify that the pod is running, use the following command:

  kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

- You should see pod(s) starting with the name {{ include "helm-webapp-cve-processor.fullname" . }} in the Running state.

Get Job Logs
------------------------
- To verify that the pod is running, use the following command:

  kubectl logs pods/{{ include "helm-webapp-cve-processor.fullname" . }}- -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

- You should see pod(s) starting with the name {{ include "helm-webapp-cve-processor.fullname" . }} in the Running state.

Uninstalling the Chart
----------------------
- To uninstall/delete the {{ .Release.Name }} deployment, use the following command:

  helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

- This will remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and delete the release.


Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the pod is not in the Running state, check the pod events:

  kubectl describe pod -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "helm-webapp-cve-processor.fullname" . }}

- Ensure that the DockerHub credentials are correctly set and that the image is available.
